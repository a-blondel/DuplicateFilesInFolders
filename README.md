# What is it ?

Got pictures (or any type of files) on different drives but can't figure out which ones are duplicates ?  
Got duplicate files in the same (or not) folder but can't find them as they aren't named identically ?

This **Windows** tool aims to verify the **MD5 checksum** of every files from the directories you give as input **(Beware: it also checks every subdirectories of given directories)**, and produce a report indicating :
- Every files analysed
- Every duplicates found, formatted as delete statements for CMD. That way you are free to check if the result is good, and execute the delete statement if wanted.

The report will be created in the same folder from wich the .exe is run.
